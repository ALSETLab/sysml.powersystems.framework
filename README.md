### Framework Design for Power Systems Modeling and Simulation

#### Requirements Project: Req_Modeling&Simulation
It is a SysML project that provides functional and non-functional requirements design, for Modeling and Simulation tools for Power Systems.
1. Functional requirements are specified and designed with Use Case diagrams. Describe **functionalities** for both Modeling and Simulation tools.
2. Non-Functional requirements are specified and designed with Requirements diagrams. Describe **technical specifications** for both Modeling and Simulation tools.
