### Software Engineering Requirements for Interoperable and Standard-Based Cyber-Physical Power System Modeling Tools


#### Requirements Project: Req_Modeling&Simulation
This is a SysML project that provides functional and non-functional requirements design, for interoperable and standard-based cyber-physical modeling and simulation tools for electrical power systems.

It contains the following software engineering requirements:

1. Functional requirements are specified and designed with Use Case diagrams. Describes **functionalities** for both Modeling and Simulation tools.
2. Non-Functional requirements are specified and designed with Requirements diagrams. Describes **technical specifications** for both Modeling and Simulation tools.
